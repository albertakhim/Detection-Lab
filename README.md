### Detection-Lab

Objective
The Detection Lab project was developed to create a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The main objective was to ingest and analyze logs using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to replicate real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on initiative aimed to enhance knowledge of network security, attack methodologies, and defensive tactics.

### Skills Learned

Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
Understanding common attack patterns, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.
Acquiring practical, hands-on experience in cybersecurity operations, including setting up, managing, and troubleshooting security environments.


### Tools Used


Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
